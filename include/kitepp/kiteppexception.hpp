/**
 * @brief kitepp saves you the hassle of detecting API errors by looking at HTTP codes or JSON error responses. Instead,
 * it raises aptly named exceptions that you can catch. `kiteppException` is derived from `std::exception` and, along
 * with other useful methods like `code()`, `message()`, provides `what()` method. You should catch exceptions of this
 * class. All kitepp exceptions barring `libException` are derived from this class. `kiteppException` being a abstract
 * class, you cannot create it direectly. Instead, use exceptions provided in `kiteexceptions.hpp` file.
 * @attention libExcpetion isn't derived from this class. You'll either have to catch it directly or catch
 * `std::exception`.
